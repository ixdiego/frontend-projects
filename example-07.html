	<!-- Make me look like Example 05, with the stacked sub-content divs floated beside the sidebar. This time, use fluid percentage widths instead of pixel values! See what happens when you resize your browser window. Where does it break? Bonus: try making sidebar a pixel width and main a percentage. What happens then? How would you avoid this if you needed the sidebar to always be at least N pixels wide? -->


	<!--POSSIBLE ANSWER: IT BREAK ONLY ON THE DIVS FLOATED LEFT, AS SOON AS THE TEXT IS LARGER THAN THE SHRINKED SIZE OF THE DIV WHEN MAKING THE BROWSER AS THIN AS POSSIBLE? ALSO, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I MADE .SIDEBAR 1PX IS THAT IT WAS JUST REALLY THIN. THE ONLY SOLUTION I SEE HERE IS TO SIMPLY GIVE IT A PIXEL VALUE AND FLOAT THE SIDEBAR TO THE RIGHT WITH THE APPORIATE MARGINS FOR THAT DIV? -->
