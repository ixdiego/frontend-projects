.container {
	width: 1024px; /* what happens to the widget boxes when you change this width? */
	margin: 0 auto;
}


.main-content {}
/* hint! what do you need to add here? */


.main-content:after{
	content: " ";
  border: 1px solid black;
  display: block;
  clear: both;
  visibility: hidden;
}

.main-content div {
	margin: 10px;
}
.widget {

	float:left ;
	/* how do you make the widgets float next to each other? */
	/* what happens when you change float left to float right? why? */
}


.footer {
	/* hint! */
	clear: both;
}


/* Bonus: what happens if you make a couple of the widgets taller than the other? */

/* QUESTION: I DID IT BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT HAPPENED. IN THIS CASE I MADE NUMBER 3 600PX AND WIDGET 4, 5, 6, ALIGNED NEXT TO IT. THEN NUMBER 7 FLOATED ALL THE WAY LEFT AGAIN. WAS IT BECAUSE NUMBER 3 BEING 600PX WAS NO LONGER "IN THE WAY" OF NUMBER 7 AND THE OTHERS? */

/*.tall {
	height: 600px;
}*/

/* this CSS class targets widget #5. what can you do to it to make the rows of widgets get back in order? */
.widget.fix {
	background: #8F1B65;
